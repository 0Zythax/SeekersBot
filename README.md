# Seekers Bot
This is a discontinued Discord bot which was used to interface with a spreadsheet to log points for the Test Subject Enclave faction Seekers.
There is a functionality which allows for the bot to read images to detect when items got sold using the Smugglers Bag, which
gave the end-user points. The bot can also just, give points via a command. There is also audit logs using a hacky method. I was going to add a multiplier system but I never got to doing it.
This bot is written fully in Python.

## Disclaimer
The code is a bit messy, and there will be no instructions provided on how to set-up the bot.
I couldn't be bothered to create a requirements.txt file, so you'll have to dig through the code to figure out what packages were used, sorry.
You have to download the Tesseract OCR engine, you'll need a google service account and spreadsheet and you'll have to figure out how the spreadsheet was structured.
